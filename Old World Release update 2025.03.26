Main Branch 1.0.????? Release 2025-03-26


Design

National Ambitions:
The final ambition is now called a National Ambition and may be offered early, after a player has completed 5 ambitions
The offer is triggered soon after the player reaches 75% progress towards one of the national ambitions
National Ambitions are not used for tier counting purposes i.e. they do not make regular ambition offers harder
All National Ambitions are listed in the Encyclopedia under their own category
Added new National Ambition '+250 Food, Iron, Stone, Wood and Money per turn'.  This replaces the previous ambition to stockpile 2000 of each resource
Added new regular Ambition 'Control 4 Hamlet class improvements'
Adjusted ambition threshold calculations and ambition events to allow a greater variety of ambitions to be offered

Launch Offensive changes:
Offensive effects do not apply to the leader unit
Cannot launch offensive when on cooldown
Leader unit goes on new launched offensive cooldown 
For team games, bonus orders from the offensive go to the unit owners

Continent map script changes:
Continent is now the default map script
Added new Extreme Terrain suboption 'None' and made this the default
Tribal Lands placement option removed

Other design changes:
Critical hits on cities are no longer possible 
Stun is now possible when attacking a unit in a city without any HP left
Panic now causes units that cannot retreat to become Disarmed instead of Stunned 
Enlisted units by a Zealot leader now return to full health
Hidden units now always ignore ZOC 
Money Boost bonus card swapped with Free Trireme (available at Coinage / Navigation)
National ambitions now offered at 70% completion instead of 75%
National Ambitions event enabled in no events mode
Fire shrines now have adjacent modifier to any improvement in the Mine class (now also affects Laurion Mines)
Commander leaders always grant +10XP per turn to all units (previously units had to be idle)
Free improvements are now allowed on resource tiles with a generic improvement ping. Placing a free urban improvement on a resource removes the resource without harvesting it
Adjusted ambition threshold calculations so a greater variety of ambitions gets offered
Events where the AI offers Truce on breaching a city now trigger when the city is captured instead
Can no longer build roads and improvements in territory of an ally
Water tiles no longer need to be adjacent to land in order to transfer them from one of your cities to another

Added ALLOW_CITY_CRITICAL_HITS to globalsInt, for use by modders
Mod manager no longer fully loads installed maps when fetching subscription info 
Unit XP overflow into training uses TRAINING_PER_XP for consistency
Buildable projects now use a ProductionType such as YIELD_CIVICS. Non-buildable projects do not require this
iCivics has been renamed to iCost in project.xml

UI

Setup screen changes:
Removed Options Preset dropdown from Simple setup and added Event Level
Added Reset Options button to Advanced and MP setup screens
Added difficulty mode to Advanced setup screen
