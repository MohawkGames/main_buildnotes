Main Branch: 1.0.69265 release 10/25/2023

Headline changes
  Zealot leader generals have a new action 'Apply Enlist'
  Reworked regencies
  Added option to disable tile improvement recommendations

Design
  Zealot leader generals have a new action 'Apply Enlist', which gives their next kill a 100% chance to Enlist for 3 turns, for the cost of 400 civics.  This replaces their previous 10% chance to enlist on kill.
  Reworked regencies:
    Regents no longer lead to legitimacy decay as normal leader changes do.
    The Rightful Heir will automatically become the Chosen Heir and this cannot be changed by the Regent. 
    Regents no longer cause others in the line of succession to become bypassed on becoming Regent or on giving up the throne.
    Regents who do not give up the throne become Usurpers and do cause others in the line of succession to become bypassed.
  The free Garrison in your Capital and Fair from a Traders seat can now appear on any valid tile instead of only on existing urban tiles.  As before, the locations of these can be set by using improvement pings.
  Exiting a cloud game mid turn will now save your progress and no longer reset to the start of the turn on reload
  Urban tiles no longer placed under tribal settlements unless they are city sites (applies when City Sites number is modified)
  Pharaohs of the Nile campaign - No leader turns family opinion penalty no longer applies
  Pharaohs of the Nile scenario 3 - Reduced raids and increased Amun units on higher difficulties
  Pharaohs of the Nile scenario 6 - Climate change induced Nile flooding now has a 10 turn grace period
  Tweaked capture foreign cities ambition tiers
  Sacred and Profane - Make Clergy mission requires target to be single
  Enabled Extreme Terrain and Tribal Lands map options for multiplayer Continent and Donut map scripts and Tribe Number map option for multiplayer Seaside and Bay map scripts
  Fervent trait (from the Kush Piye dynasty) now grants the bonus militia in the city the religion spreads to instead of in the capital
  Enlightenment Theology now gives +3 happiness per Monk class instead of +2 per Elder Monk
  Guilds now gives happiness per Hamlet class improvement instead of just per Town
  Random maps are more likely to have at least one luxury resource of each type (does not apply to mirror maps)
