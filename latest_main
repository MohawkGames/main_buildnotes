Design
  New mapscript - Desert
  Hardwood Forest mapscript redesign. More Tundra and Mountains in the north and more resources in the south.
  Multiple Continents map script improvements.  Continents are now placed east west rather than north south which works better with mirror and wide map options and is more consistent with other map scripts.
  Improved player start locations for team games. Teams will be placed near each other and on the same continent where possible
  Removed mirror map option from Multiple Continents 3-continent option in MP setup
  All opinion boosts from Laws are now +20 (previously ranged from +10 to +50)

  Cities captured by Tribes start at 0 health and restore 20% per turn
  Event bonuses which damage units now never kill them

  Roman shrines renamed. Vulcan -> Sol, Venus -> Feronia, Vesta -> Ceres, Mars -> Bellona
  Carthage's Shrine of Astarte is now Shrine of Baal Hammon
  Can now only demand tribute from a nation once every 10 turns
  Found religion project production no longer decays faster than other production when queued
  Added fallback ratings to Sacred and Profane traits
  Visibility in completed hotseat games is now consistent with other multiplayer modes (the map is revealed after the game is won or lost)
  Generals can no longer be reassigned on the same turn as the unit they are leading is killed (only affects network MP)
  Tweaked event occurrence rates
  Build Wonder ambitions no longer fail when a Wonder is started by another nation. Instead, they fail when the Wonder has been completed.
