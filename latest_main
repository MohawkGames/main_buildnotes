Design

Unique Unit (UU) tech bonus cards are now unlocked through culture instead of tech
First tier UU bonus cards have had their cost increased from 100 to 200, give 2 units, and require a city with Strong culture
Second tier UU bonus cards require a city with Legendary culture
Zealot leader general now performs a Heal action after each kill, instead of being able to Apply Enlist
Fervent (Piye's unique trait) now enables Apply Enlist as a leader general, at a cost of 100 civics (Wonders and Dynasties)
Ballista strength reduced from 6 to 5
Carthage city founding bonus reduced from 200 to 100 civics
Founding Christianity no longer requires ownership of a Jewish city, now requires 3 Jewish cities globally
Engineer promotion and general trait allows road building instead of bonus against siege/ships
Added new national ambition - Control three of each Legendary Improvement
Changed Control Six Legendary Cities national ambition to Control Five Legendary Cities
Send 20 luxuries is now a tier 9 ambition instead of a national ambition

When randomly assigning archetypes, characters with governor effect traits are much more likely to be assigned a governor archetype, and similarly general archetypes for characters with general traits
Killing Raiders now contributes towards goals to kill units of their original tribe
Raiders are less stubborn about raiding, if the shortest path is blocked, and will hit opportunity targets instead
Doubled Master/Elder Scribe money per Citizen, to +2/+4
Anchoring and Unlimbering states are not interrupted by attacks that apply new cooldowns (i.e. Immobilize, Stun)
Killed civilian units now count for Assyrian orders, Hero Leader Training, Epics Culture, etc
Units can pass through hostile civilian units, as long as they don't end their movement on their tile
Families and Religions suffer -40 opinion for 20 turns when their Workers and Disciples are killed
Improvements to Carthage campaign persistency

Disabled Venerate mission for and demands being given by Abandoned god in Wrath of Gods scenario
