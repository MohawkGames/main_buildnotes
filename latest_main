Main Branch 1.0.81366 release 2026-01-07

Headline changes

New Point Symmetry mirror option for MP games
Healing Shrines now give Healer effect to all units
New Ballista unit icon added

Design

Added Point Symmetry option to MP setup when Mirror Map option is selected. This enables radial mirroring around the map's midpoint, producing a layout symmetric in all directions from the center.  Players will start in opposite corners of the map
Healing Shrines now give Healer effect to all units including non-promotable ones
Heliopolis gives 0.5 orders per shrine instead of 1
Mourning trait no longer has a chance to make characters ill 
If the player doesn't have enough yields to sell to cover debts, then a queued build with no progress is cleared to get enough yields to sell, if possible
Added event for when AI forfeits a city site due to player having attacked the camp more
Many event tweaks including a buff for the Shrine of the Unknown God

Programming

AI avoids building Wonders in border cities, and especially in cities that are in danger of being captured 
AI uses disciples to build religious improvements before further spreading the religion, if possible
Pathfinder prefers to keep units hidden, have them occupy good defensive terrain, and avoid marsh, all else being equal
Added support for local storage for persistent scenario data
