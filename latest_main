Design

Sacred and Profane Clergy rework:

The Initiate into Clergy mission run by the Head of Religion has been replaced by a new mission Suggest For Clergy.  This is run via the Chancellor and uses the target characters religion
A limit of 2 Clergy per nation has been added
Clergy can now also be Courtiers and marriage restrictions have been removed
Clergy can run the Tutor as Courtier mission (even if they are not a Courtier)
Clergy give a base bonus of +30 religion opinion, modified by character opinion
Pagan Clergy have a +40% chance to become the next Head of Religion and World Religion Clergy have a +20% chance
Pagan Clergy have a new mission Pagan Sacrifices.  This targets a pagan city and has a 75% chance to increase the cities happiness and 25% chance to give an opinion penalty to the religion 
World Religion Clergy can now act as Agents in cities of their religion

In Competitive mode character yields and modifiers now scale linearly.  Ratings lower than 5 will have higher effects and higher ratings lower effects.  Previous flat 50% penalty removed.  
Character upgrades for leaders, governors, and generals (under retirement age) now include only traits, if possible
Doubled money income from connected foreign cities  
Event-caused tribal raids will now target the player, even if at Peace or if another foreign city would be a better target
Added doubled Desert map size as a map option (this is the same size as Deserts were before being reduced recently)
Tweaks to the New Difficulty level - start with an added Militia, increased civics and training per turn
Unimproved water tiles can now be exchanged between cities
Tiles cannot be exchanged between cities if that will cause a city territory to no longer be contiguous
Increased tier of grove luxuries ambition
