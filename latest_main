Design
Commander leaders now get +100% bonus attack strength while Flanking (up from +50%)
City Site ownership is now determined first by who has a military unit on the tile (in the case of an ally)
Event options with the chance to gain 1 delayed trait now get offered as a fallback rating if the trait is invalid.
Non-allied tribe settlements that are not on city sites no longer get absorbed into a nation by border expansion  
Revised city site placement algorithm so that you can now have player starts closer than two minimum city site distances apart, if the map is too small for the number of players
Higher-tier wonders now count toward lower-tier goals - e.g. Legendary wonders will be counted for the "have 1 Strong wonder" goal 
Can now hurry obsolete units already in the build queue
End turn is canceled if there are new decisions to make after automated units move

Added mod support for specific tribes and tribe strengths to use central AI to coordinate their units
Change mod Infos files now processed after append mod Infos files

Map scripts now use internal variable/functions to set terrain formations, without persisting them to tile data since formations are only needed at generation time
Removed terrain formation ID and tile elevation from network data 
Removed some unused terrain renderers
Removed unnecessary calls for timeline border tiles
Got rid of tile latitude in network data and saves. The save now instead stores the min/max latitude of the generating mapscript, latitudes are calculated as needed
Optimization to avoid calls to native code in a few places
  
UI
Added list of past events to character tooltip 
The location of initial city improvements (Garrison, Fair) can be specified by using the relevant improvement ping on a valid urban tile. This replaces the old system of ctrl+clicking the preferred tile.

Added toggle to tutorial events to allow the tutorial to be disabled directly from the event
