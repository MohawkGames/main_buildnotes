Main Branch 1.0.77501 release 2025-04-30

Headline Changes

New map script Rejuvenation added to the Wrath of Gods DLC.  A barren desert that becomes more temperate and acquires resources over time
Ships can now enter defensive formation, which works in the same way as Fortify for melee infantry.  Ship promotion balance tweaked
Added upgrade icon to city production buttons for specialists that replace an existing specialist

Design

Ships can enter defensive formation, giving +10% defence against Ships per turn, up to a max of 30%.  A counterattack is gained at maximum level and each attack against the ship removes one level. 
Grappler promotion immobilizes ships instead of stunning them and no longer has an attack penalty
Fireship promotion no longer gives +10% attack
Cockswain promotion gives +20% strength in National Territory instead of Rout 
AI more likely to break alliances with poor opinion 
Ruthless AI declares war on a winning player even if it's not completely ready to do so 
When a tribal alliance ends and there are tribal units in the same tile as player units, the tribal units are bounced, not the player units
When a national alliance ends, a unit in its own territory never gets bounced
Expose Agent mission takes 1 turn to complete (was 2)
Rise of Carthage campaign tweaks and rebalancing 
Heroes of the Aegean scenario 2 rebalanced 
Slums worker discount removed and militia discount increased (Behind the Throne)
New map script Rejuvenation added (Wrath of Gods)
Occurrences that affect water movement (eg Hurricane) affect player-controlled water as well, both for water units and land units using anchored tiles (Wrath of Gods)
Hurricanes remove Anchored status from ships (Wrath of Gods)

Notes for Modders

Five separate memory types (MemoryCharacter, MemoryTribe, MemorReligion, MemoryFamily, MemoryPlayer) are now one type, Memory. The base file name is memory.xml
Mods that add memories need to rename files, e.g. memoryCharacter-add.xml should be memory-character-add or just memory-add. The dash after memory is the important part
Event bonuses are now just Memory / Forget, for all memory types. Events should take care to apply the bonus to the right subject. For example, a Memory bonus applied to a SUBJECTCLASS_CHARACTER subject is the equivalent of the earlier MemoryCharacter bonus

It is recommended to upload new versions of map mods in order to take advantage of fixes and new features
