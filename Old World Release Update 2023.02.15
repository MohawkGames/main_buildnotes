Headline changes
  New Bay map script added
  Added Happiness

Design
  New Bay map script added - temperate coastal map broken up by a large but shallow inland sea 
  Added Happiness.  Cities now have a Happiness level with positive happiness which changes to a Discontent level when happiness is negative.  This changes the presentation of discontent but has no mechanical effect.
  Hunters no longer get a bonus to Nets (they still get their Camp bonus)
  Traders now have +100% Nets output instead of faster Hamlet growth
  The Lighthouse now gives faster Hamlet growth in all cities instead of +5 money per specialist.
  Landowners now get +5 Money per farm instead of +20 Money from Crops 
  Orators now give +1 Order per Friendly city (down from +2)
  Families get -1 opinion per turn without a leader from that family
  Citizens now give -1 Family Opinion (down from -5)
  Ranged units no longer get a land/water penalty attacking ships, but an extra tile is added to the range for calculating damage.
  Ships no longer have the Brave and Shieldbearer promotions available
  Disciples now consume Food 
  Induct into Clergy now can be applied to all characters except Oligarchs, Dukes, or Princes
  Removed clergy rating yield bonuses, removed money upkeep cost, religion opinion bonus set to 30
  Renamed The Great Ziggurat to The Ziggurat 
  Combat damage now rounds up after collateral modifier instead of before.  The effect of this is to increase splash damage (pierce, cleave, shrapnel etc) by 1 in some circumstances.
  Can no longer stun units in cities
  Competitive mode now prevents events that give free Laws without the prerequisite tech
  Production cost increase of Settlers, Workers, and Disciples is now per unit type.  This means the cost of a Disciple is only increased by the number of Disciples you have previously built in that city and is no longer effected by previous worker or settler builds.

  Teenagers can now adopt a religion
