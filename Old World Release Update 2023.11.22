Main Branch: 1.0.69678 Release 11/22/2023

Headline changes
  Lower difficulty levels are now easier and a new lowest level difficulty added 'The New'
  Many balance changes including nerfs to Persian UUs and Schemer leaders
  Kush now available on the Middle East premade map
  AI combat, strategic and performance improvements

Design
  New difficulty level added The New.  Reworked AI penalties on lower difficulty levels.
  Passive AI will not capture cities from a player who originally founded them
  Persian Unique Units (Palton Cavalry and Cataphract Archer) now have a range of 1.  This can be increased by effects which increase range (Hills, Marksman promotion etc).
  Reduced Schemer leader orders per war from 2 to 1
  Kush now available on the Middle East premade map 
  Reduced Desert mapscript size to be in line with other maps 
  Upgrading an improvement now also upgrades the specialist, if the existing specialist is less advanced than the starting specialist of the upgraded improvement
  Garrison getting pillaged no longer removes existing governor
  Autonomous rule now repairs damaged cities that cannot passively heal completely in a turn, even if it's currently building something else
  Collateral damage (pierce, splash etc) formula simplified. This now does the percentage of the damage of a direct attack to the same unit, rounded up.  This change increases collateral damage dealt in some circumstances.
  Tweaked a few trait inheritance outcomes
  Added new trait flavor text and changed some to only appear dependent on character age. Reduced the likelihood of vomiting and diarrhea when characters become severely ill.
  Tweaked tutorial events to make them less prone to cluster on the same turns
  Generals of tribal units now get XP 
  Tribes now attack civilian units at a lower priority 
  Former regents now get a trait giving +1 wisdom and keep their King/Queen Regent title
  In the Rise of Carthage scenarios, Balearic Slingers are now buildable on the islands instead of regular Slingers. Regular Slingers can upgrade to Balearics.
  Rise of Carthage scenario 4 starting city happiness boosted

  Units that require a non-buildable improvement are no longer considered a possible build, unless that improvement is present
