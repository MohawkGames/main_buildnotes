Design

  Wonder rebalancing:
    Ishtar Gate: increased growth per culture level in the city from 1 to 2
    Necropolis: Now gives all cities 3 civics per pagan religion instead of 2 happiness per temple
    Royal Library: increased science output from connection to other teams, but reduced output from own team (Wonders and Dynasties)
    Al Khazneh: Now gives free silk, perfume, ebony, porcelain, and furs, and a Caravan every 5 turns.  Removed money bonus and 3 instant Caravans (Wonders and Dynasties)
    Mausoleum: increased culture modifier from 40% to 50%
    Hagia Sophia: Now gives 2 happiness levels for every city on completion and 2 happiness per turn per culture level in the wonder city. Removed global happiness per turn
    Via Recta Souk: Now gives all on-map luxury resources. Replaced wonder city growth by 2 growth per culture level. Removed happiness per luxury and Caravans
    All improvements that produce units create one on the first turn they are built. Affects Holy Sites, Al Khazneh, Cothon and Colosseum
    Al Khazneh and Royal Library disabled in FFA games with two or fewer human players and no AI nations (Wonders and Dynasties)

    8 Elder specialists in each Family Seat 
    Polytheism and 4 Elder Acolytes in each Family Seat
    Stockpile 2000 of each resource 
    Send 20 luxuries
