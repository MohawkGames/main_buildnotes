Main Branch 1.0.75717 Release 2025-01-15

Headline Changes

Difficulty settings renamed, to make the difference between presets and individual settings clearer.  Settings outside the presets are now shown as 'Custom' difficulty in game with a breakdown of the individual settings.
Increased variety of crowning ambitions.  This should make winning an ambition victory easier and more varied.
Grand Vizier rework (Behind the Throne).  A big change to Grand Viziers based on player feedback, they now act as governors in all cities without a named governor and only control production in these cities. 

Design

Difficulty rename: 
  The Advanced Setup Difficulty setting is now called Prosperity
  The Simple Setup Difficulty presets remain as they were
  Difficulty components are grouped together and indented under difficulty mode in the game parameters tooltip
  Difficulty will be listed as Custom for combinations outside of the simple difficulty presets
  Distant raids are now tied to Tribe Level instead of Difficulty
  Achievements related to difficulty are now tied to Difficulty instead of Prosperity

Changes to Ask to Declare War mission:
  Ask to Declare War mission now requires a Leader with the Schemer archetype.  Removed mission tech requirement and lowered opinion needed to Cautious.  Disabled mission for allies
  Ask to Join War mission added, where you must already be at war with the target.  This requires Pleased opinion
  With Ruthless AI enabled, war requests will be denied if the player is close to victory
