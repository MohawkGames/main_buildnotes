Design

Childbirth rate: leaders with no children now have a higher chance to have kids

Distant raids: No longer include ships
AI unit building: 
  The traits of Grand Viziers and AI leaders now influence their decisions of how many units they build
  Heroes, Commanders, Tacticians, and Warlike characters build more units and Builders, Scholars, Diplomats, and Timid characters build fewer units
  AI is more likely to build units in cities that give unit promotions and experience
Alliance events: Most alliance and tribal alliance events now either require a diplomat leader or are disabled in competitive mode
City reveal: Cities are now revealed from a greater distance, like settlements
City capture: Cities now take 1 turn longer to capture

Starting units no longer spawn on the same tile, even if they are allowed to do so
