Design
  Cleric seat no longer gets a free Religion on founding.  Instead they get access to a one-time city project which founds a religion, available at Developing culture.
  Trader cities get Money per Specialist instead of Culture
  Sage cities now get a free Archive I and lose the Urban Specialist Cost discount
  Statesmen cities get a -25% Specialist Resource Cost and lose the free Treasury I
  Bullion Resources have been renamed to Precious Resources.  Map scripts amended to make these resources more common.
  Discontent penalty for having more citizens than urban tiles removed.
  Stunned cooldown now reduces at the start of the player's turn instead of the end.  This prevents teammates from using a stunned unit later in the same turn.
  Stunned cooldown now changes to Attacked Cooldown after one turn, for UI clarity.
  Damaged Tribal cities no longer produce units.  This only affects cities taken over by Tribes, not Tribal camps.
  Cities captured by a tribe start at 50% HP
  Hurried builds now never have production overflow
  Eliminated players in team games will now automatically gift units and goods to their closest teammate
  Seaside map script improvements
