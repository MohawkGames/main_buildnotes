Headline changes

  95 new events added
  Many design changes including new map scripts, game options and rebalancing

Design
  New map script Player islands.  Each nation gets their own island, with optional empty islands.
  New map script Highlands.  Inland map with lots of mountain ranges and elevated terrain.
  Inland Sea map script reworked.  Now has more variation and is more Mediterranean-like.
  New game option Random Tech Tree.  Shuffles the position of each tech within its column.
  No longer possible to lose when dying without an heir, another character will take over
  
  Tech tree changes: 
    Infantry Square now requires Battleline instead of Bodkin Arrow
    Windlass now requires Architecture instead of Scholarship
    Added Luxury bonus cards to the tech tree - on Forestry, Metaphysics, Coinage, Portcullis and Lateen Sail
    Added Kush UU bonus techs - Free Medjay Archer (Composite Bow) and Free Beja Archer (Bodkin Arrow)
    Hittite UU 2 bonus tech (Free Three Man Chariot) science cost reduced from 800 to 600 (to be consistent with other UU bonus techs)

  Free-for-all multiplayer game player start improvements:
    All map scripts now spread out the players as much as possible, at the expense of selecting the best terrain. 
    Added a different, experimental, player placement for highlands and coastal rain basin map scripts, which are relatively uniform land maps
  
  Player start adjustment to try to avoid being placed in a small area surrounded by impassable terrain
  More resources between city sites, especially at low city site density
  Baths class improvements give one extra Happiness per turn
  AI (nations and tribes) now have a chance to cancel an alliance when at cautious opinion or lower 
  Split Away from Court event class into individual classes. This lowers the frequency of some events that were triggering too often (i.e. imprisoned events)

  Regents will now be forced for child leaders up to age 6 when previous leader died and up to age 12 if previous leader abdicated
  Rider family seat bonus now includes the addition of horses, elephants, and camels to tiles within the city territory, no longer allows building units without resources.

  Meritities is now Righteous instead of Revered (Wonders and Dynasties)
