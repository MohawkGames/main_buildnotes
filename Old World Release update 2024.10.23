Notes for modders

Units in unit.xml: 
Add a bRegular flag (after bGeneral in the order) to denote a "regular military" unit. The flag makes the unit count as "regular military" in the stats, and the AI assumes that non-regular units are worth less.

Event Links in eventLink.xml:
aeSubjectClasses is no longer needed. The link will save all subjects in the triggering event and figure out the classes by itself.
If you only want some subjects saved, put iNumSubjects on the link (in eventLink.xml) to save that many subjects.
Use iNumSubjects = 0 if you don’t care about any subjects and are only using the link as a shortcut to trigger something else.
For immediate event links, tag the link with bImmediate = 1 in eventLink.xml. Use EventLinkAdd in eventOption.xml. EventLinkStart will be removed in the future.
