Design

Temporarily hidden units can no longer occupy territory that they would not be able to occupy if not hidden (i.e. foreign territory while at Truce)
Scouts are no longer removed from the map after establishing an Agent Network and instead get a 5 turn cooldown and are hidden for 10 turns
Veneration Theology gives +10% spread chance, up from 5%
Revelation Theology gives +20% spread chance, down from 25% 
Enlightenment Theology now gives +3 Happiness only for Monks in Monasteries of Religions that have that Theology
