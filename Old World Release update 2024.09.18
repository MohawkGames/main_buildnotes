  Most map scripts in multiplayer now place all human players on the same landmass. 
    Exceptions are Archipelago, Continents, Player Islands and Disjunction
    This is optional on Mediterranean and Lakes and Gulfs maps using 'Connected Player Starts' as this can significantly affect player starting positions

  Laurion Mines now enable a Miner specialist on the tile 
  Undo is no longer available in cloud games using the Strict (Teams) turn style.  This does not affect cloud games using Strict (Players) which still have undo.
